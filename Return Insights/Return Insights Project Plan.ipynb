    "### Project Objective:\n",
    "Calculate the expected return of certain financial assets using multiple methods:  \n",
    "1) Arithmetic Mean  \n",
    "2) Geometric Mean  \n",
    "3) Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also calculate the volatility and Sharpe Ratio to assess the risk and risk-adjusted performance of each asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Data Import\n",
    "Import daily prices (from 1990 to today) of selected assets from Yahoo Finance.\n",
    "Examples of assets: Apple, Coca-Cola, and Starbucks stocks, SPY, CAC 40, SMI, Nasdaq, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** We need to use the adjusted price, which includes dividends, to calculate the Total Return Index.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Total Return Index (TRI) Calculation\n",
    "For each asset:\n",
    "- Calculate the daily logarithmic returns to account for continuous price variations. \n",
    "- Sum the daily returns to obtain the annual logarithmic return.\n",
    "- Convert this annual logarithmic return to a simple annual return for easier interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Logarithmic returns are preferred for their ability to add continuously, making calculations more accurate for time series data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Calculation of Mean and Volatility\n",
    "- Calculate the mean of the annual returns to obtain an overall measure of the historical return for each asset.\n",
    "- Calculate the volatility of the annual returns to measure the risk associated with each asset.\n",
    "- Calculate the Sharpe Ratio to assess risk-adjusted return:\n",
    "  Sharpe Ratio = (Expected Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Volatility\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** To estimate the risk-free rate, we will import the yield of a T-Bill (Treasury Bill) and annualize it to obtain the risk-free rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Geometric Mean Calculation\n",
    "Calculate the geometric mean from the annual returns to reflect the average return while accounting for the compounding effect over multiple periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** We use logarithmic returns for this calculation, as described in step 2, because they provide more accuracy when dealing with continuous price changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Market Representation with the MSCI World Index\n",
    "Import daily prices of the MSCI World Index (from 1990 to today), representing the global market return. Repeat the step 2 to obtain the annual returns. Calculate the excess return for each year.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** To calculate the excess return, subtract the risk-free rate from the annual market return. Use the annual yield of Treasury bills (T-bills) as the estimate for the risk-free rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: Estimation of Beta and Expected Return (CAPM)\n",
    "For each asset:\n",
    "- Calculate the excess returns by subtracting the risk-free rate from the asset's annual returns.\n",
    "- Perform a linear regression of the asset's excess returns on the excess returns of the MSCI World Index to estimate the beta (=slope) and the alpha (=intercept).\n",
    "- Conduct two statistical t-tests to determine if beta is significantly different from zero (H0: beta = 0) and if we can assume that alpha is equal to 0 (H0: alpha = 0).\n",
    "    - If the null hypothesis (H0: beta = 0) is rejected, calculate the expected return using the CAPM: Expected Return (CAPM) = Risk-Free Rate + beta * (Market Return - Risk-Free Rate). If we can not assume that alpha equals 0, the expected return is given by:\n",
    "Expected Return (CAPM) = Risk-Free Rate + beta * (Market Return - Risk-Free Rate) + alpha\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion: Interpretation of Results\n",
    "- **Arithmetic Mean:** Provides the average historical return, useful for an overall view of the non-compounded return.\n",
    "- **Volatility:** Measures the degree of variation in an asset's returns over time, indicating the level of risk or uncertainty.   \n",
    "- **Sharpe Ratio:** Assesses the risk-adjusted return by comparing the additional return per unit of risk. A high Sharpe Ratio indicates a potentially attractive investment.\n",
    "- **Geometric Mean:** Reflects the average return adjusted for the compounding effect, important for multi-year returns.\n",
    "- **CAPM:** Provides an estimate of the expected return based on each asset's beta and the assumptions of an efficient market. The beta coefficient measures the sensitivity of an asset’s returns relative to the market. A beta greater than 1 implies that the asset is more volatile than the market, while a beta less than 1 suggests that the asset is less volatile. If alpha equals 0, it indicates that the CAPM is a good estimator of the asset’s return. If alpha is not equal to 0, it suggests that the asset is either underperforming (alpha < 0) or outperforming (alpha > 0) relative to the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is important to approach these methods with caution. They rely on historical data, which may not always be a reliable predictor of future performance. The CAPM also operates under strict assumptions—such as market efficiency and investors' homogeneous expectations—that may not hold in the real world. Additionally, external factors like changing market conditions, economic shifts, and investor sentiment can significantly impact asset returns and risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, while these models are valuable tools for evaluating potential investments, they should be used in conjunction with other qualitative analyses and a broader understanding of market dynamics to make well-informed investment decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Assumptions of CAPM:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Investors diversify their portfolios optimally to maximize returns.\n",
    "- All assets are tradable, with no transaction costs or restrictions.\n",
    "- Investors have homogeneous expectations regarding asset returns.\n",
    "- Investors can borrow and lend freely at the risk-free rate.\n",
    "- The market is efficient, meaning that asset prices fully reflect all available information.\n",
